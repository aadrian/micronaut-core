To help you easily understand what Micronaut is doing at startup and when a particular bean is created Micronaut includes a dependency injection tracing feature which can be activated in a number of different ways including via the api:context.ApplicationContextBuilder[] API.

The simplest way to activate injection trace mode is using an environment variable. For example if you are running your application locally you can do:

.Activating Injection Trace Mode
[source,bash]
----
MICRONAUT_INJECT_TRACE=.+ ./gradlew run
----

Or for Maven:

.Activating Injection Trace Mode
[source,bash]
----
MICRONAUT_INJECT_TRACE=.+ ./mvnw mn:run
----

Trace mode will output useful information such as:

* The Configuration profile of the application
* The applicable configuration and where it came from
* The beans that are created, where they were created and how long was taken to create the bean.
