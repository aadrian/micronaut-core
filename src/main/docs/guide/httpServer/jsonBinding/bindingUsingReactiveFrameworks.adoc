From a developer perspective however, you can generally just work with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and can optionally use a Reactive framework such as https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] or https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor]. The following is an example of a controller that reads and saves an incoming POJO in a non-blocking way from JSON:

snippet::io.micronaut.docs.server.json.PersonController[tags="class,single,endclass", indent=0, title="Using Reactive Streams to Read the JSON"]

<1> The method receives a `Publisher` which emits the POJO once the JSON has been read
<2> The `map` method stores the instance in a `Map`
<3> An api:http.HttpResponse[] is returned

Using cURL from the command line, you can POST JSON to the `/people` URI:
