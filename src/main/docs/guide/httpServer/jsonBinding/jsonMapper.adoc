You may be used to work with https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.7/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.html[Jackson's `ObjectMapper`]. However, we don't recommend using Jackson's `ObjectMapper` directly; instead you should use api:json.JsonMapper[], an API almost identical to Jackson's `ObjectMapper`. Moreover, both <<jsonBinding, Micronaut Serialization and Micronaut Jackson Databind>> implement api:json.JsonMapper[].

You can inject a bean of type `JsonMapper` or manually instantiate one via `JsonMapper.createDefault()`.
