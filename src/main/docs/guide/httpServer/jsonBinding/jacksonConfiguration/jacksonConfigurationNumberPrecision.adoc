During JSON parsing, the framework may convert any incoming data to an intermediate object model. By default, this model uses `BigInteger`, `long` and `double` for numeric values. This means some information that could be represented by `BigDecimal` may be lost. For example, numbers with many decimal places that cannot be represented by `double` may be truncated, even if the target type for deserialization uses `BigDecimal`. Metadata on the number of trailing zeroes (`BigDecimal.precision()`), e.g. the difference between `0.12` and `0.120`, is also discarded.

If you need full accuracy for number types, use the following configuration:

jackson:
  deserialization:
    useBigIntegerForInts: true
    useBigDecimalForFloats: true
